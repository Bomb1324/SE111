 <P>This movie is something.<i>Die hard</i> is a movie, I would recomend if they want to see Action, The suspents, some of the best one liner and seeing a great cast of people. I would say Alan Rickman played perfectly as the main villan during the whole movie. Just see how Alan tricked  the main hero jhon McClane, by impersonating as an amercain to reveal him self as the villan. This movie rocks!</P>
 <p>I first watch this movie, about 3 years ago. A friend recomended me this movie because I had never heard a bout this film.But all in all this moive is a 10/10</p>

    <h3>Triva</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>The Teddy Bear McClane Brings His Kids Also Appears in The Hunt for Red October</li>
       <li>Hans Gruber Almost Wasn't Played by Alan Rickman- Rickman says after reading the script "What the hell is this? I'm not doing an action movie."</li>
       <li>Producers Spent a College Tuition's Worth on Glass- With a lot of glass being destoyed the movie prodution spent $130,000 on glass alone.</li>

    </ul>
